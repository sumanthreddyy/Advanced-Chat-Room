	go to the required repository

Step 6: The admin can kick the user(he can re-join), user can be banned where his username is registered 
	in a text file that will be checked when he wants to rejoin again, the program does not allow that User. [/kick username and /ban username /unban username are the commands]

The user named tanjiro was kicked from the server, however he can rejoin again to the chat room 

Step 7: Once the user is banned from the server, he cannot rejoin until the admin unbans him.

We can see the username is stored in the bans.txt file for further blocking of the user to enter the chat room

Step 8: When the user wants to get back on the server he is not allowed until the admin unbans him.

We can see the user being not allowed to the chat room as he was banned .

The user is now in the chat room as the admin unbanned him and can now the user can use the facilities of the chat room.
